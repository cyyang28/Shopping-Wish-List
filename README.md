# *Shopping Wish List*

## Description of this application:
A **shopping wish list** that any shopper can use to keep track of items they want to purchase. I'm interested in this project because as 
a busy student, I often find it difficult to remember all the items that I want to buy. It would also be a nuisance and a 
waste of time having to go back to a store upon realizing that one forgot to buy something. Therefore, this app would 
make shopper's lives easier, whether they are shopping online or in store.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a product having a title, price, quantity, and star rating to my shopping wish list, and to be able to increase the product quantities later on.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a product from my shopping wish list or decrease the quantities of the product.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the titles, prices, quantities, and ratings of the products in my shopping wish list.
- As a user, I want to be able to select and rate a product in my shopping wish list on a scale of 0 to 5 star based on how much I need it.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my shopping wish list to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my shopping wish list from file
