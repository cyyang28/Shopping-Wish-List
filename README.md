# *Shopping Wish List*

## Description of this application:
A **shopping wish list** that any shopper can use to keep track of items they want to purchase. I'm interested in this project because as 
a busy student, I often find it difficult to remember all the items that I want to buy. It would also be a nuisance and a 
waste of time having to go back to a store upon realizing that one forgot to buy something. Therefore, this app would 
make shopper's lives easier, whether they are shopping online or in store.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a product having a title, price, quantity, and star rating to my shopping wish list, and to be able to increase the product quantities later on.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a product from my shopping wish list or decrease the quantities of the product.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the titles, prices, quantities, and ratings of the products in my shopping wish list.
- As a user, I want to be able to select and rate a product in my shopping wish list on a scale of 0 to 5 star based on how much I need it.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my shopping wish list to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my shopping wish list from file

## Phase 4: Task 3:
To improve my design, I would:
- Improve coupling and minimize duplicated code by extracting more methods. For example, some of my addButton methods in WishListGUI class have code clones, and it would help extract a method and replace them with call to the extracted method. I also have some duplicated code to fix within my addEventListener, addLabelText, and resetText helper methods in WishListGUI class. Making these changes in the future would make my code more readable and allow me to fix bugs more easily.
