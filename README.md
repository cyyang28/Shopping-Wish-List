# *Shopping Wish List*

## Description of this application:
A **shopping wish list** that any shopper can use to keep track of items they want to purchase. I'm interested in this project because as 
a busy student, I often find it difficult to remember all the items that I want to buy. It would be a nuisance and a 
waste of time having to go back to a store upon realizing that one forgot to buy something. Therefore, this app would 
make shopper's lives easier, whether they are shopping online or in store.

## User Stories:
